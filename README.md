# Welcome!

This repository hosts the supplementary materials for the "Quantum Curriculum Development with Microsoft Quantum Development Kit" workshop presented at QCE20 (see [the workshop information and detailed program](https://tcnickolas.github.io/qce20-quantum-curriculum.html)):

* Deep dive: [debugging Q# code](./debugging/).

## Installation instructions

The workshop will cover both developing Q# projects in Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code/other text editors and creating Q# Jupyter Notebooks. 
You will be able to follow the material and do a subset of exercises without installing the QDK locally, with online tools only. 
However, for the best experience we recommend to install QDK locally following the [installation guide for developing Q# projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line) and the [installation guide for Q# Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quickstarts/install-jupyter).

## The Quantum Katas

The first session of the workshop will introduce the [Quantum Katas](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/) - a collection of tutorials and programming exercises for learning quantum computing and Q# programming. 
Again, you will be able to follow the material without local installation, but for the best experience we recommend you to install QDK and clone the Quantum Katas repository.
