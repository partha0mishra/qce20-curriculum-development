# Deep Dive: Resource Estimation for Q# Code

*We'll cover this type of tasks in the third session of [the workshop](https://tcnickolas.github.io/qce20-quantum-curriculum.html) together with other unusual types of tasks and the motivation behind them. This is more of a demo for you, but feel free to try it out before the workshop!*

This task focuses on resource estimation for quantum algorithms, using a very simple example.

> [QDK documentation on resource estimation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/user-guide/machines/resources-estimator).

## Installation instructions

Same as for the debugging task, there are two ways to approach this task:

* As a Q# project.  
  Please follow [this QDK installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line). We recommend to use Visual Studio or Visual Studio code with corresponding extensions (they are very helpful for looking for syntax errors!), but you can also use any other editor.  
  In this scenario, the Q# code for the task can be found in the `DeutschJozsaCode.qs` file.
* As a Q# Jupyter Notebook.  
  Please follow [this QDK installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quickstarts/install-jupyter). You can also [run it online without any installation](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tcNickolas/qce20-curriculum-development/main?filepath=resource-estimation/DeutschJozsaNotebook.ipynb).
  In this scenario, the Q# code can be found in the `DeutschJozsaNotebook` notebook.
