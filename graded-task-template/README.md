# Deep Dive: Automatically Graded Assignments

*In the second session of [the workshop](https://tcnickolas.github.io/qce20-quantum-curriculum.html) we developed a simple automatically graded assignment on preparing a basis state. This is the code we developed for it, and the set up to run it online.*

## Installation instructions

There are two ways to approach this task:

* As a Q# project.  
  Please follow [this QDK installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quickstarts/install-command-line). We recommend to use Visual Studio or Visual Studio code with corresponding extensions (they are very helpful for looking for syntax errors!), but you can also use any other editor.  
  In this scenario, the Q# code for the task can be found in the `Tasks.qs` file.
* As a Q# Jupyter Notebook.  
  Please follow [this QDK installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quickstarts/install-jupyter). You can also [run it online without any installation](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tcNickolas/qce20-curriculum-development/main?filepath=graded-task-template/GradedTask.ipynb).
  In this scenario, the Q# code can be found in the `GradedTask` notebook.
